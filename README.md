# Monte Carlo Simulation for Wind Turbine Energy Production Analysis

This C++ code is a simplified implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation for analyzing wind turbine power generation over multiple simulations. It models the wind speed using a Weibull distribution, calculates the power output of a wind turbine based on the wind speed, considers uncertainty in power generation due to wind speed variability, and estimates the average annual energy production of the wind turbine over multiple runs (simulations).
